SQL (Structured Query Language) - is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language, it also includes procedural elements.

SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks. Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of such standards, though, most SQL code is not completely portable among different database systems without adjustments.

DML(Data Manipulation Language) - is the subset of SQL used to add, update and delete data:	
    - INSERT - adds rows to an existing table; 
    - UPDATE - modifies a set of existing table rows; 
    - DELETE - removes existing rows from a table;
    - MERGE - is used to combine the data of multiple tables. It combines the INSERT and UPDATE elements. It is defined in the SQL:2003 standard; prior to 	that, 	some databases provided similar functionality via different syntax, sometimes called "upsert".

DDL (Data Definition Language) - manages table and index structure. The most basic items of DDL are the CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP and TRUNCATE statements:
    - CREATE - creates an object (a table, for example) in the database;
    - ALTER -  modifies the structure of an existing object in various ways, for example, adding a column to an existing table or a constraint;
    - TRUNCATE - deletes all data from a table in a very fast way, deleting the data inside the table and not the table itself. It usually implies a subsequent 	COMMIT operation, i.e., it cannot be rolled back (data is not written to the logs for rollback later, unlike DELETE);
    - DROP - deletes an object in the database, usually irretrievably, i.e., it cannot be rolled back;
